# 1. Introduction
The purpose of this Shiny Dashboard is to create an updated and interactive version of the Piface Java applet created by Russell V. Lenth _CITATION_. The ability to use interactive sliders and text boxes allows the user to see in real time how certain inputs, e.g. significance level or power, affect outputs, e.g. sample size or power. This will not only provide answers, but also provide education to the user about co-dependencies of the inputs and outputs.

## 1.1 R and R Studio
This Shiny Dashboard is programmed using `R` version 3.2.2 and RStudio version 0.99.489. Four packages, besides the base packages included in R, are used for dashboard setup and for statistical calculations.

## 1.2 Packages
### 1.2.1 [shiny](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/shiny.pdf) 
The `shiny` package in R "Makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R."_CITATION (URL above)_ It uses R functions to create HTML code for a web page. There are various different input, display, and settings options that can be customized all within the same shiny application.

### 1.2.2 [shinydashboard](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinydashboard/shinydashboard.pdf)  
The `shinydashboard` package expands beyond the `shiny` package to add themes to the dashboard for a more attractive look.

### 1.2.3 [pwr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pwr/pwr.pdf)  
The `pwr` package calculates power and sample sizes for various different situations using Cohen _1980_ as a basis for the calculations. In this dashboard, the `pwr` package is used for the calculations of the One Sample Mean, One Sample Proportion, Two Sample Means, and Two Sample Proportions tabs.

### 1.2.4 [gsDesign](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gsDesign/gsDesign.pdf)  
The `gsDesign` package is used for power and sample size calculations of time to event studies. Specifically, it incorporates factors targeting the time component that is common these types of studies.

# 2. Using the Application
The first thing to choose is which tab to use with each representing a different situation. After the tab selection, the selection of what to solve for is the next step. All of the tabs have a `selectizeInput` located at the top of the dashboard page.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
selectizeInput(inputId = "solvefor_OM",
               label = p("Solve For"),
               choices = c("Sample Size", "Power", "Precision"),
               selected = "Sample Size",
               multiple = FALSE,
               options = NULL,
               width = "100%")
```

The `selectizeInput` above is used for both the One Sample Mean and One Sample Proportion tabs and shows that Sample Size, Power, and Precision can be calculated. The rest of the dashboard page will then update based on what is being solved for.

The setup of each of the tabs is very similar with only the specific inputs being slightly different. The One Sample Mean, One Sample Proportion, Two Sample Means, and Two Sample Proportions tabs are all set up with study information on the left-hand panel and calculation information as well as the calculation itslef on the right-hand panel. The Time to Event tab is slightly different in that the study information in on the left-hand panel, population information in on the middle panel, and the calculation information and the calculation itself on the right-hand panel. For all of the tabs, the calulation is outlined in green as seen below.

Within the tabs, there are text, slider, and selector inputs. Each numeric variable has both a text box and a slider that can be manipulated. Updating either of them will have the same effect and will automatically be updated once the other is manipulated. The calculations will be performed immediately after an input is manipulated. It should be noted that although the calculated variable text box and slider can be manipulated, it will not cause any new calculations to be performed.


# 3. Application Tabs

## 3.1 One Sample Mean
### 3.1.1 Parameters

* Mean - The mean of the target population
* True Mean - The mean of the reference population
* Standard Deviation - The standard deviation of the measure for the target population
* Sample Size - The sample size of the experimental population
* Significance Level - The probability of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis
* Power - The probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis
* Precision - The distance in one direction of the confidence interval from the mean
* Confidence Interval - The interval in which the mean is likely to fall within

### 3.1.2 Use of Parameters
The power, sample size, precision, and confidence interval are all parameters that can be calculated, while the power and sample size are also parameters that can be used as inputs parameters for calculations. All of the other parameters can be changed and manipulated resulting in different values for sample size, power, and precision.

### 3.1.3 Statistical Explanation

### 3.1.4 Example
An independent one-sample t-test is used to test whether the average of a sample differ significantly from a population mean

__Solving for Sample Size:__ A study is being performed to examine the heart rates of people after having walked for 5 minutes. Heart rate is a measurement that can be summarized using the mean. Say it is known that the average resting heart rate is 70 beats per minute. The goal of the study is to determine if the heart rate of people having walked for 5 minutes is different than an average resting heart rate. The researches performed a pilot study and have data about the mean and standard deviation of the heart rate, say 72 and 5 respectively. They decide that they want there study to be based on a significance level of 0.05 with 80% power. The researches want to know how large of a sample they will need to determine people walking for 5 minutes have a different heart rate than the resting heart rate of an average person.

The researches would use the following values to determine what they need:

* Mean = 72
* True Mean = 70
* Standard Deviation = 5
* Significance Level = 0.05
* Power = 0.8

With the values put in by the researchers, they would find that a sample of 51 people would be required.

__Solving for Power:__ Instead of determining how large of a sample the researches would need before they performed the study, they decided to just collect the data now and determine later how much power they would have later. They were able to record heart rates after walking 5 minutes for 25 people and found a mean of 72 and a standard deviation of 5. They still require a significance level of 0.05. The researchers want to know how much power their study has.

The researchers would use the following values to determine what they need:

* Mean = 72
* True Mean = 70
* Standard Deviation = 5
* Significance Level = 0.05
* Sample Size = 25

With the values put in by the researches, they would find that their study has 48% power.

__Solving for Precision:__ The researchers are now trying to report their findings from the study and would like a present a 95% confidence interval for the mean heart rate after walking for 5 minutes. The researches want to know how precise their measure is.

The researchers would use the following values to determine what they need:

* Mean = 72
* Standard Deviation = 5
* Significance Level = 0.05
* Sample Size = 25

With the values put in by the researches, they would find that their measure has a precision of 1.96 resulting in a 95% confidence interval of 70.04 to 73.96.
